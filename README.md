# üè´ Campus Placement Data Analysis for Engineering Colleges üè´

## Overview
This project explores the impact of various factors on the placement status of engineering college students. The factors analyzed include internships, projects, workshops, aptitude scores, SSC and HSC marks, extracurricular activities, placement training, and soft skills ratings.

## üìÇ Data Importing
The dataset is imported from a CSV file named `placement.csv`.

## üîç Analysis and Results

### 1. Internship Effect on Placement Status
- **Objective:** Determine if the number of internships affects placement chances.
- **Conclusion:** 
  - No internships result in lower placement chances.
  - One internship is not sufficient.
  - Two internships significantly increase placement chances.

### 2. Project Effect on Placement Status
- **Objective:** Analyze if the number of projects impacts placement status.
- **Conclusion:** 
  - Most students do projects.
  - Three projects notably improve placement chances.

### 3. Workshop Effect on Placement Status
- **Objective:** Examine if attending workshops influences placement.
- **Conclusion:** 
  - Few students take three workshops.
  - More than one workshop increases placement likelihood.

### 4. Aptitude Test Score Effect on Placement Status
- **Objective:** Assess the impact of aptitude test scores on placement.
- **Conclusion:** 
  - Higher aptitude scores correlate with better placement rates.
  - Placed students generally have higher scores.

### 5. SSC Marks Effect on Placement Status
- **Objective:** Investigate the effect of SSC marks on placement.
- **Conclusion:** 
  - Higher SSC marks increase placement chances.
  - Placed students have higher median SSC marks.

### 6. HSC Marks Effect on Placement Status
- **Objective:** Evaluate the impact of HSC marks on placement.
- **Conclusion:** 
  - Higher HSC marks lead to better placement outcomes.
  - Placed students tend to have higher median HSC marks.

### 7. Extracurricular Activities Effect on Placement Status
- **Objective:** Determine if extracurricular activities affect placement.
- **Conclusion:** 
  - Students involved in extracurricular activities have higher placement rates.
  - Lack of extracurricular activities correlates with lower placement chances.

### 8. Placement Training Effect on Placement Status
- **Objective:** Analyze the effect of placement training on placement status.
- **Conclusion:** 
  - Placement training significantly increases placement likelihood.
  - Students without placement training have lower placement rates.

### 9. Soft Skills Rating Effect on Placement Status
- **Objective:** Assess the impact of soft skills ratings on placement.
- **Conclusion:** 
  - Students with soft skills ratings below 4 are less likely to be placed.
  - High soft skills ratings (4.5 to 5) greatly enhance placement chances.

## üìä Visualizations
The analysis includes multiple bar plots, box plots, and pie charts to illustrate the effects of the various factors on placement status.

## üìù Conclusion
The data analysis reveals that internships, projects, workshops, aptitude scores, SSC and HSC marks, extracurricular activities, placement training, and soft skills ratings are significant factors that influence the placement status of students in engineering colleges. Improving these factors can enhance students' chances of being placed.
